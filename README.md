# DevMo-Corentin-L-o

A student project to learn mobile development.
This is an application supposed to help with organising evenments. It is not done, as the goal is to focus on some functionalities.

Here is a short description of the screens of the application :

## Login screen 
It displays two text input, and a button "login", under the title of the application (Crewmate)
  When the user clicks on the button, two things can happen :
  <ol>
  <li>The password input is "admin", the application then goes to the next screen</li>
  <li>The password isn't "admin". Both text fields are reset.</li>
</ol> 

## List of events
The Event List Screen is composed of a List of Event, with a picture for each event, a title, the event's organizer name and the date of the event. Each event have their own informations. There is also two button, for edit and delete the events, but currently, theses button have no functionnality implemented

When the user click on an event, it open a specific page with the informations of the event, with the title, the picture, the date, the name of the organizer, and the description of the event
  <!---

At the bottom of the screen, three toggle buttons allow to navigate between the list of events, the chat and the user's profile.

## Chat
It's an empty screen. Coding a chat is hard.

## User 
A screen displaying the user name used when login. And that's all.
