# DevMo-Corentin-L-o

A student project to learn mobile development.
This is an application supposed to help with organising evenments. It is not done, as the goal is to focus on some functionalities.

Here is a short description of the screens of the application :

## Login screen 
It displays two text input, and a button "login", under the title of the application (Crewmate)
  When the user clicks on the button, two things can happen :
  <ol>
  <li>The password input is "admin", the application then goes to the next screen</li>
  <li>The password isn't "admin". Both text fields are reset.</li>
</ol> 

## List of events

  <!---
Corentin, décrit ta liste ici, et le comportement quand tu cliques sur un event
--->
At the bottom of the screen, three toggle buttons allow to navigate between the list of events, the chat and the user's profile.

## Event



## Chat
It's an empty screen. Coding a chat is hard.

## User 
A screen displaying the user name used when login. And that's all.
